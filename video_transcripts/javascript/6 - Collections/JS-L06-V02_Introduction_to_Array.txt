- [Narrator] Let's look at the variable scale that's declared on line two of musicalscales.js. What we have here are a collection of values that are stored into one variable. What does this mean? Let's draw this out. I'm gonna go ahead and draw the array. We have do. We have re. We have mi. Fa. So. La. Ti, and do. So here's our array. This is var's scale that we declared on line two. This whole collection is called an array. The whole collection is called an array. And just a single one of these is called an element. Each of these are elements of the array. Each of these elements have an index or a position in the array. The first do is at zero. Re's at one, Mi's at two. Fa's at three so's at four, and so on and so forth. On line two, the variable that we've declared a scale has eight elements in its array. Starting at the index of zero going through the index of seven. Now we don't necessarily have to store just strings. We can also do other values, so let's do this. Let's take out ... I'm gonna take out our strings. Because javascript doesn't always have to be strings. You can put numbers in there. Maybe, for example, we have the average temperatures. If you look at to calculate average dot js which is also located in the collections folder, you will notice that in there you're left with a different type of an array, we're using numbers. So what would that look like? Well let's draw those in here. We have 70. We have 55, 65, 55, another 55, 60, and 70. We don't have anything here. This isn't declared. I'm just gonna mark an X in that. This is what an array looks like. An array is a collection of values that can be stored as a collection into one single variable.
