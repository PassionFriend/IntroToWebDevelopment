Course Introduction 



If you have gone through our HTML and CSS courses, you have been working on a restaurant site.  What if we wanted to have rotating images on our home page to showcase some of our news or upcoming specials?  What about our contact form? What can we do to make sure that people put in their contact information?



In this course, we will look at JavaScript, a programming language originally designed to add functionality and interactivity to our HTML pages.  We briefly look at the history and evolution of the language.  From there, we will look at the various building blocks provided by JavaScript: from the smallest blocks of values and variables, graduating to statements, and adding decision logic.  Once we get through that, then we will refactor our code so that we aren't copying and pasting code repeatedly, through applying the concept of functions.  Once we have this foundation in place, we can see how we can apply all of this to a group of objects called collections.  Finally, we bring it all together and see how we can use JavaScript to interact with web pages.



By the end of this course, you will have a high-level understanding of JavaScript and should be able to use it to add a carousel of images to your restaurant site, add validation to your contact form, and even write an application where you take in user input, do some calculations, and write the result to the browser.
